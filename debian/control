Description: OpenRFS Open Source Replicated File System
 OpenRFS aims to be a replacement for another replicated file system. With OpenRFS you may have sincronized filesystems 
 between two machines in real time.
 .
 OpenRFS not implement any filesystem at low level, it simply envolve a directory with FUSE and log all operations
 in a database for send to another machine. It uses librsync to send changes, that makes no need for send entire
 large files when changes are small.
